I want to inversitage the sort method and their performance.

enjoy to copy and use it

I use 100,000,000 numbers as the test dataset. the target is changing the decrease dataset to increase dataset.

the origin version of merge sor will spend 10.41 seconds on my computer.

the insert optimaized version is  4.26 seconds.

the insert and parallel version is 2.65 seconds which is 40% better than the insert optimaized version.
